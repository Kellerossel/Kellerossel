Hi,

I dont have much Experience in anything programming related. Furthermore my english speaking (or in this case writing) abilities are pretty limited.<br>
After all I don't even know why I do this to me and start so many programming Projects, but for some reason I do, making me want to cry from time to time.<br>
Anyways, have fun and visit my (kinda faulty) Website: <a href="https://kellerossel.github.io"/>
